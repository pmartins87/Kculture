# Prize Solver Roadmap — 2026-09-16

## Current solver handoff — 2026-09-18

Active branch: `research/prize-solver-v0`.

The Top-30 programme teacher and observation parity infrastructure remain valid, but the
standalone exact-prefix router is now **closed as a competitive candidate**.

Binding adaptive-expert gate:
- workflow `35307879368`, engine `1.32.7`;
- 64 paired matchups / 128 complete episodes;
- exact current V47 and V39 source identities verified;
- static control W/L `5/64 = 0.078125`;
- router W/L `5/64 = 0.078125`; W/L delta `0.0`;
- mean paired terminal-margin improvement `+2770.47`;
- V47 block: `0/32 -> 0/32`, margin `-9784.63 -> -6970.75`;
- V39 block: `5/32 -> 5/32`, margin `-7807.22 -> -5080.16`.

Binding decision:
`CLOSE_STANDALONE_ROUTER_OPEN_BOUNDED_TRANSACTION_MARKET_SEARCH`.

Interpretation: route selection contains real economic signal, but it does not explain the
competitive gap to full adaptive agents. Do not rescue the tree with more depth, seeds or
checkpoint tuning. The solver architecture remains active, now focused on the control
surface actually used by the public frontier: transaction guards, sale timing/queue
microstructure, funding/storage repairs and bounded state-conditioned transformations on
top of a strong adaptive programme.

Current result:
`docs/strategy/PROGRAMME_ADAPTIVE_EXPERT_GATE_RESULT_2026-09-18.md`.
Machine-readable summary:
`data/programme_teacher/2026-09-18/ADAPTIVE_EXPERT_GATE_SUMMARY.json`.

Immediate gate: measure oracle W/L headroom from one bounded transaction/market
intervention on a complete strong adaptive backbone before training another selector.
No Kaggle submission and no Ryzen action are currently required.

The FP001_STATUS/FP001_ROADMAP files are absent on this branch; do not silently create
competing copies or change other branches as part of this solver update.

## Historical record (superseded where inconsistent with the current handoff)

## Objective
Build and submit a competitive Kaggriculture agent based on **Solver + Opponent Model + Value Learning**, optimizing for hosted Kaggle performance and prize probability. The roadmap is frozen unless empirical evidence shows a milestone is infeasible.

## Core operating rule
Hosted Kaggle submissions are part of the experimental loop, not a final ceremony. Intermediate solver versions will be submitted deliberately to measure real hosted transfer while offline training continues.

## Frozen architecture
1. **Exact-engine solver/search**: branch-and-rollout from cloneable intermediate states.
2. **Opponent model**: legal public-state inference, including CR086-derived hidden-stock pressure estimates.
3. **Value/policy learning**: learn `V(s)` and/or `Q(s, macro)` from exact-engine counterfactual outcomes.
4. **Hosted calibration**: Kaggle results decide whether changes transfer; local strength alone never proves hosted strength.

## Milestones to first full trained-solver submission

### PS1 — Executor correctness and economic viability
**Current stage.**

Deliverable: Prize Solver V4 with valid end-to-end play for 720 turns.

Gate:
- no crash or illegal action;
- crops actually appear after PLANT;
- animals bought are deployable rather than trapped in shed;
- positive economy against basic baselines;
- packageable hosted wrapper.

**Hosted sensor S0:** as soon as PS1 passes, build and submit the V4 solver-only package. It is not the final solver; it establishes the first hosted anchor for this architecture.

### PS2 — Exact counterfactual rollout dataset
Use the exact engine to clone states and compare strategic macros from the same branch state.

Staged dataset sizes:
- Pilot: ~2,000 branch states;
- Scale 1: ~10,000 states;
- Scale 2: ~50,000+ states only if the learning curve continues improving.

Each state stores legal runtime features, macro returns, terminal rewards/margins, oracle macro, and heuristic regret.

Gate:
- zero engine/parity failures;
- diverse seeds, phases and opponent families;
- train/validation split by seed/opponent family rather than random row leakage.

**Ryzen 9:** preferred machine for bulk rollout generation once PS1 is frozen. GitHub Actions remains useful for reproducible smoke/gates, not necessarily for the bulk compute.

### PS3 — Value/Policy Model V1
Train a model to estimate `Q(s, macro)` or rank candidate macros from current legal state.

Initial model progression:
- linear/tree baseline;
- compact MLP only if it materially improves held-out ranking/regret;
- no large neural network merely for complexity.

Gate:
- beats `money_diff` and heuristic-plan baselines on held-out states;
- materially lowers mean held-out macro regret;
- inference fast enough for Kaggle runtime.

**Hosted sensor S1:** submit Solver + Value V1, keeping the opponent model disabled so the hosted delta isolates value learning.

### PS4 — Online Solver/Search V1
At runtime, generate admissible strategic macros and use learned value to evaluate/prune them. Exact deep rollouts remain offline training machinery; hosted runtime uses bounded search compatible with competition limits.

Gate:
- deterministic/legal runtime;
- no future/private forbidden information;
- latency and package size within hosted constraints;
- local exact-engine regression suite passes.

**Hosted sensor S2:** submit Search + Value V1.

### PS5 — Opponent Model integration
Feed legal opponent-pressure estimates into state representation/search, including the preserved CR086 latent inventory estimator and public behavioral features.

Gate:
- opponent-conditioned value/search improves held-out regret over PS4;
- ablation proves gain comes from opponent features, not accidental policy drift.

**Hosted sensor S3:** submit full **Solver + Opponent Model + Value Learning** agent.

### PS6 — Hosted-calibrated training loop
Use hosted results from S0/S1/S2/S3 to decide where offline objective diverges from Kaggle reality. Do not replace the architecture; calibrate data mixture, macro set, opponent families and value target.

Loop:
`hosted evidence -> targeted new rollout data -> retrain -> ablation -> new hosted candidate`.

Use the daily submission budget intentionally. Whenever there are mature single-factor candidates, prefer contemporaneous control/treatment submissions instead of leaving the budget unused for days.

## Definition of the first "solver-ready" Kaggle file
A package counts as the first full trained-solver candidate when all are true:
1. strong programmes may serve as proposals/priors; current-state selection must be active;
2. current-state solver/search is active;
3. learned value/policy is active;
4. opponent model is active;
5. legal/parity/runtime gates pass;
6. package is frozen with SHA/provenance;
7. it is actually submitted to Kaggle and receives a hosted submission ID.

This corresponds to **S3**. S0-S2 are deliberate development submissions and should occur before S3.

## Submission ladder
- **S0:** V4 solver-only — first hosted architecture anchor.
- **S1:** V4 + Value V1 — isolate value-learning effect.
- **S2:** Search + Value V1 — isolate online solver/search effect.
- **S3:** Search + Value + Opponent Model — first full trained Prize Solver.
- **S4+**: hosted-calibrated iterations, one major change at a time where possible.

## Stop conditions / anti-infinite-work rules
- No milestone can remain in 'research' indefinitely: it must end in PASS, FAIL/CLOSE, or a hosted submission.
- Do not enlarge datasets if validation learning has saturated.
- Do not add model complexity without held-out improvement.
- Do not postpone a hosted submission merely because a later model may be better.
- Do not redesign the architecture in response to one bad local result or one user comment; change only from reproducible evidence.

## Immediate next action
Finish PS1 V4 smoke + economic trace. If PASS, freeze/package S0 immediately and prepare its Kaggle submission while PS2 rollout generation is being prepared for the Ryzen 9.
