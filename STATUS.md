# STATUS — Kculture live source of truth

## Current solver handoff — 2026-09-18

Active branch: `research/prize-solver-v0`.

### Hosted-entrypoint correction is binding

All public-agent promotion work must use
`kaggle_environments.agent.get_last_callable`.

Exact public V47 hosted entrypoint:
`_y_agent_shopherd`.

The original treatment submission `56333579` is mechanically invalid and must never be
interpreted as O-RW1 competitive evidence.

### O-RW1 hosted-faithful evidence

Causal gate `35363453097`:
- score delta **+0.0833333**;
- 8 non-win -> win flips;
- 0 negative-W/L states.

Autonomous runtime gate `35367785929`:
- 64 pairs / 128 episodes;
- BASE `0.6250`;
- O-RW1 `0.71875`;
- score delta **+0.09375**;
- 14 non-win -> win flips;
- 0 win -> non-win regressions;
- 2 tie->loss pair regressions;
- all 4 opponent blocks nonnegative in mean W/L.

### Corrected hosted package — PASS

### Corrected hosted A/B R2 — VALID BUT IMMATURE

Submission workflow:
`35373555439`.

CONTROL:
- submission **56336025**;
- exact V47 archive;
- entrypoint `_y_agent_shopherd`;
- registered `2026-09-18 17:19:39.130000 UTC`.

TREATMENT:
- submission **56336027**;
- corrected O-RW1 archive SHA
  `997aa273cb64c6acf933f8d719bd358c47d07871f6e42ac056003155499c68c9`;
- entrypoint `_kc_orw1_entrypoint`;
- registered `2026-09-18 17:19:40.807000 UTC`.

Registration separation: **1.677 seconds**.

Both passed hashes and official-loader checks immediately before submit.
Daily usage after pair: **4/5**.

First joint COMPLETE checkpoint (`2026-09-18 17:24:36 UTC`):
- CONTROL: `COMPLETE`, rating field `600.0`;
- TREATMENT: `COMPLETE`, rating field `600.0`.

Replay forensics workflow `35374217511`, artifact `10559931321`:
- CONTROL listed episodes: **1**;
- TREATMENT listed episodes: **1**;
- externally attributable resolved games: **0 / 0**.

Therefore `600.0 vs 600.0` is **not evidence of neutrality or promotion**.

Binding state:
`ORW1_HOSTED_AB_R2_VALID_BUT_EXPOSURE_ASYMMETRIC_AWAIT_BALANCED_EXTERNAL_GAMES`.

Latest authenticated checkpoint:
- CONTROL rating `718.3`, 2 listed episodes, **1 external game resolved**, record **1-0**, margin **+57,846**;
- TREATMENT rating `600.0`, 1 listed episode, **0 external games resolved**.

The current rating gap is therefore **exposure asymmetry**, not O-RW1 regression
evidence. Do not compare the ratings until both arms have meaningful external exposure.

### Frozen hosted maturity rule for R2

To prevent score-watching, freeze this before external outcomes accumulate:

1. First **informative** R2 hosted checkpoint requires at least **32 externally attributable
   completed public games per arm**. At that checkpoint compare rating, W/L/T, seat split,
   opponent-strength distribution and matched/current population context.
2. Final **promotion/regression** verdict must not be made before **100 completed public
   episodes per arm**, consistent with the project's earlier hosted maturity discipline.
3. A rating field without supporting episode maturity is diagnostic only.
4. Do not tune O-RW1 from intermediate hosted outcomes.
5. Preserve the fifth daily submission slot; no nearby O-RW1 variant is authorized.

## Historical record (superseded where inconsistent with the current handoff)

Updated: 2026-09-15

## Mission / objective

Maximize the probability of winning or reaching the prize frontier in Kaggriculture. Novelty is not the objective. Every legal piece of accumulated competitive, replay, mechanics and economic knowledge remains admissible unless stronger evidence supersedes it.

Authoritative branches:

- competitive source of truth: `fix/kaggle-parity-v1`
- experimental mechanics/integration: `research/first-principles-economy-v1`

## Engine / legality lock

- official evaluation path: `kaggle-environments==1.32.7`
- frozen upstream reference commit: `28b6d8af3ce73926b3d0fda1410c1ddd8384ab8c`
- public `town.unlocked_shops` is shared/legal runtime state and may contain repeated shop names
- no runtime identity, rating, EpisodeId, hidden seed, future state or direct opponent-private features
- original final holdout remains sealed

## Competitive target / calibration

Frozen external snapshot 2026-09-14: leader ~`3191`, rank 10 ~`2958`; target remains roughly `3000+`.

Strongest exact project-hosted anchor:

- **CR053_REAL** — submission `56073870`, checkpoint ~`2064.8`
- exact SHA `095080e791bd8d58369893c1a421beb57b7f64c2808c011f576e09684ffb9a15`
- source run `34105008373`, artifact `10012004237`

Other exact anchors: CR052_REAL ~`1749.2`; CR083 ~`1619.9`; CR086 ~`1612.6`.

Critical warning: exact-byte league `34802917553` locally ranked CR083/CR086 above CR053 although hosted Kaggle ranks CR053 materially higher. Local H2H is useful for mechanics, causal interventions, catastrophe and diversity, **not** as a hosted-rating oracle.

## Retained competitive / FP001 knowledge

- CR086 legal latent-opponent-supply estimator and SELL-priority operator are retained; CR086 itself is not the preferred backbone.
- CR087/CR088 elite macro/replay knowledge is retained; direct tape backbones remain closed.
- H1 WHEAT town-pulse carry, H1B sale deferral, H8/B3+DAILY CARE, H9 demand representation, H10 batching/routing, H11 fertilizer conversion and M6S1 remain reusable primitives/modules.
- M6S1 is a genuine economic module, not a standalone competitive backbone.

## CR089 — COMPLETE / FAIL

Run `34923802262`: C5_BASE and C5_M6S1 each **0W–132L**, 11/11 zero-score edges, zero mechanical failures. Static C5/C5+M6S1 are closed as competitive backbones; M6S1 survives as a module.

## CR090 — COMPLETE / FAIL

Run `34979280512`. Mechanics exact. YARN adaptive SHEEP minus delayed COW was negative; MILK adaptive COW minus delayed SHEEP strongly positive; natural adaptive policy did not beat delayed COW.

Binding verdict: `CR090_H9_CAUSAL_FAIL_CLOSE_SIMPLE_SPECIES_ADAPTATION`. No threshold rescue; H9 survives only as a state feature/prior.

## CR091 — COMPLETE / PASS

Binding rerun: **`34990757344`**, research commit `f49bff2e7adde626b01b9fa3c0413f7fc97d9649`.

Artifact: `cr091-hierarchical-market-option-gate-v1`, ID `10406926564`, ZIP SHA-256 `d6d9a5a7cb187e48dc4cb187e348adb7fff4d10666f18f27b4030ccc8ad2f3d0`.

The earlier run `34987640694` remains invalid/non-binding because its direct-`exec()` harness failed CR052 package semantics.

CR091 compared exact CR053 against exact CR053 plus the exact CR086 latent-supply SELL-priority operator, changing only the order of existing market orders.

Mechanics on the valid rerun:

- 128/128 episodes valid;
- failures: **0**;
- parity violations: **0**;
- exact farmer/hand parity every call;
- exact normalized market-order multiset parity every call;
- exact BASE full-action parity every call;
- O1 active with **1,075** market reorders.

Seat-balanced edge-score deltas `O1 - BASE`:

- CR052_REAL: `0.0000`
- CR053_REAL: `+0.1875`
- CR083: `0.0000`
- CR086: `0.0000`

Summary: 4/4 nonnegative edges, mean delta `+0.046875`, maximum `+0.1875`, worst regression `0.0`.

Binding verdict: **`CR091_LATENT_OPTION_TRANSFER_PASS_ADVANCE_ROUTER`**.

Interpretation: CR086 is not promoted as a backbone. Its latent-priority mechanism is promoted as frozen separable option **O1** on exact CR053. No threshold retuning.

Result: `docs/strategy/CR091_HIERARCHICAL_MARKET_OPTION_RESULT_2026-09-15.md`.

## Current binding gate — CR092 broad O1 transfer / router labels

Protocol: `docs/strategy/CR092_BROAD_OPTION_ROUTER_LABEL_PROTOCOL_2026-09-15.md`.

Purpose: test frozen O1 on the broader 11-edge CR089 population and collect causally clean public-state labels for a later router.

Frozen population:

- exact anchors: CR053_REAL, CR052_REAL, CR083, CR086;
- macro reps: `r01`, `r02`, `r03`, `r06`, `r07`, `r09`, `r10` from the exact CR089 frozen population artifact `10378299284`.

Fresh evaluation:

- seeds `91401..91406`;
- both seats;
- 12 games/treatment/edge;
- 132 games per treatment, 264 total;
- exact hosted-faithful package runner;
- no hosted submission.

Counterfactual label rule: for each matched BASE/O1 episode, record O1's legal state immediately before its first actual market reorder. A label is admissible only if that strategic-state hash exactly matches BASE's state hash at the same step. Primary label is `outcome(O1) - outcome(BASE)`; terminal money is diagnostic only. Opponent ID is offline stratification metadata only and is forbidden as a router feature.

Frozen broad-survival gate requires mean edge delta >= `+0.02`, >=8/11 nonnegative edges, worst regression >= `-0.125`, macro mean delta >=0 and no new zero-score catastrophe from a BASE edge >=0.25.

Frozen routing signal requires at least 8 positive and 8 negative hash-valid labels spanning at least two opponent strata per sign.

Implementation on research branch:

- `tools/cr092_broad_option_edge.py`
- `tools/cr092_aggregate.py`
- `.github/workflows/cr092-broad-option-router-label.yml`
- workflow/head commit `b42347617a6967eeb2862fde23737c7538d3b9d3`
- active run **`35015135956`**
- prepare job already PASS: all 11 opponent packages downloaded and SHA-verified.

Frozen outcomes:

- broad survivor + heterogeneous labels -> `CR092_BROAD_PASS_HETEROGENEOUS_ADVANCE_ROUTER`
- broad survivor without downside support -> `CR092_BROAD_PASS_O1_ADVANCE_NEXT_OPTION`
- broad fail but strong heterogeneous option value -> `CR092_BROAD_FAIL_HETEROGENEOUS_ADVANCE_ROUTER_DISCOVERY`
- otherwise -> `CR092_BROAD_FAIL_CLOSE_ALWAYS_ON_O1`
- mechanics failure -> no strategic verdict.

## Closed / do-not-retune absent new evidence

CR078/079, CR080 replay stitching, CR081 static market-prefix transplant, CR082 1-NN imitation, CR084 FEED rescue, CR085 Pareto gating, direct CR088 tapes, static C5/C5+M6S1, fixed C3S2/C2S3, simple CR090 first-shop species rule.

## Hosted policy

No CR092 outcome automatically authorizes a Kaggle submission. Hosted slots remain high-information population sensors, used only after a mechanically exact state-adaptive or multi-option candidate survives broad fresh-seed evaluation without a major catastrophe edge.
