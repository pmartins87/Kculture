# ROADMAP — Kculture live plan

## Current solver handoff — 2026-09-19

Active branch: `research/prize-solver-v0`.

### Hosted pair — preserve both slots

Maturity snapshot around 100 episodes:
- CONTROL `56336025`: rating **2429.1**, 103 listed / 102 resolved external, 76-24-2;
- O-RW1 `56336027`: rating **2506.7**, 106 listed / 105 resolved external, 60-44-1.

These are not matched opponent populations. Raw W/L is not a causal A/B comparison.
The hosted treatment remains higher-rated; do not replace either slot while offline
selector/value work proceeds.

### Option-value Ryzen V1 — production PASS

User Ryzen run completed:
- 250/250 fresh seeds;
- 1,500 BASE matchups;
- **3,000 counterfactual option labels**;
- **584 unique state hashes**;
- **0 failures**.

O-RW1:
- mean score delta **+0.096**;
- 370 positive / 82 negative / 1,048 neutral;
- mean margin delta **-161.6493**.

O-TW1:
- mean score delta **+0.14**;
- 436 positive / 16 negative / 1,048 neutral;
- mean margin delta **+35.7173**.

Population decomposition:
- V47 mirror: mean score delta **+0.354**;
- V48: W/L delta 0;
- Tactical Memory: W/L delta 0.

### Selector Audit V1 — whole-seed PASS; cross-family gate still OPEN

Binding local rerun on 2026-09-19:
`OPTION_VALUE_SELECTOR_AUDIT_PASS_LEARNABLE_SEED_HOLDOUT`.

Whole-seed held-out test:
- 492 rows;
- selector realized delta **+0.1341463**;
- always-fire delta **+0.1138211**;
- row oracle **+0.1382114**;
- **132/136** positive rows captured;
- **0/24** negative rows fired;
- nonzero sign accuracy **0.9625**;
- selected ridge lambda **0.1**, threshold **0.1**.

The state-grouped diagnostic remains strong:
- selector realized delta **+0.1372981**;
- **187/187** positive rows captured;
- **0/17** negative rows fired.

This establishes learnability across fresh whole seeds in the V1 sampled population. It does **not**
yet establish transfer to an unseen opponent family: the original leave-one-opponent-out diagnostic
still failed to recover the V47-mirror gains when that family was fully withheld.

### Ryzen V2 option-value production — COMPLETE / MECHANICS PASS / COVERAGE LIMIT FOUND

Binding user Ryzen run from source commit
`2c402f54462bb31be4f1061c64efe11613b24253`:

- 150/150 fresh seeds;
- 7 opponents;
- both seats;
- O-RW1 + O-TW1;
- 2,100 base matchups;
- **4,200 counterfactual labels**;
- **1,238 unique state hashes**;
- **0 failures**;
- exact engine `1.32.7`.

O-RW1:
- mean score delta **+0.0352381**;
- 208 positive / 60 negative / 1,832 neutral;
- mean margin delta **-88.5776**.

O-TW1:
- mean score delta **+0.0571429**;
- 253 positive / 16 negative / 1,831 neutral;
- mean margin delta **+85.7710**.

Critical population result:
- V47 mirror: **458 positive / 76 negative**, mean score delta **+0.3183333**;
- Ready Stock: 2 positive / 0 negative;
- `2715.6`: 1 positive / 0 negative;
- V48, Conditional Memory, Tactical Memory, Best Market: W/L-neutral.

Thus **458/461 positive labels (99.35%) are V47-mirror labels**.
Outside V47 there are only **3 positives in 3,600 rows** and no negative W/L labels.

Binding interpretation:
- V1 seed-holdout learnability was real;
- more seeds on the same two-option library are **not** the current bottleneck;
- a production multi-family selector is blocked by **option coverage**, not raw model capacity;
- do not scale this exact dataset merely by brute force.

Result:
`docs/strategy/OPTION_VALUE_RYZEN_V2_RESULT_2026-09-19.md`.

### G1 — option-library composition: BINDING RESULT

Binding evidence comes from the seven successful shards of workflow **`35426256016`**.
The aggregate job failed only because the lightweight aggregate environment omitted
`kaggle-environments`; the seven strategy shards themselves were all mechanically clean.

56 matched contexts total:
- BASE score rate: **0.7857143**;
- O-RW1: **0.8392857**;
- O-TW1: **0.8392857**;
- BOTH: **0.8392857**;
- BOTH vs BASE: **+0.0535714**;
- score-regressing opponent blocks: **0/7**.

Mirror block:
- BASE **0.500**;
- RW1/TW1/BOTH **0.875**.

Binding decision: **`OPTION_LIBRARY_COMBO_ADVANCE`**.

Interpretation:
- retain O-RW1 + O-TW1 together as the current **offline option-library host**;
- composition is W/L-safe on this gate;
- BOTH adds no W/L over the best single option in this sample;
- no hosted Kaggle submission follows from this alone.

Result doc:
`docs/strategy/OPTION_LIBRARY_COMBO_RUNTIME_V0_RESULT_2026-09-19.md`.

### G2 — adaptive wrapper proposal oracle V3: BINDING RESULT

Valid workflow **`35426189093`**:
- 56 branch states;
- 84 exact candidate rollouts;
- zero failures;
- exact engine `1.32.7`;
- mechanical PASS.

Decision: **`WRAPPER_PROPOSAL_OUTSIDE_MARGIN_ONLY`**.

Overall:
- score delta **0.0**;
- nonwin→win flips **0**;
- 8 positive-margin states;
- mean oracle margin delta **+393.39**.

Outside modern41:
- BASE and oracle score rate both **1.0**;
- score delta **0.0**;
- 8/32 positive-margin states;
- mean oracle margin delta **+688.44**.

All promoted proposals came from `router_2715`, at step 0:
- V47: `BUY_PRODUCT WHEAT 7; SELL WHEAT 2`;
- router proposal: `BUY_PRODUCT WHEAT 13; SELL WHEAT 13; BUY_PRODUCT WHEAT 13`.

That proposal improved margin against weaker outside blocks but was harmful against the
hard strata V47 mirror, Ready Stock and V48. It is **not** a promotable generic option.

Result doc:
`docs/strategy/ADAPTIVE_WRAPPER_PROPOSAL_V3_RESULT_2026-09-19.md`.

### V4 activation — hard-stratum discovery

The conditional V4 protocol is now **activated in staged form** because valid V3 produced
no W/L headroom.

Evidence-driven amendment made before V4 execution:
- discovery now targets hard BASE non-win strata rather than arbitrary family diversity;
- highest priority is **V48**, where valid V3 lost by small margins and one-turn proposals
  did not flip the result;
- broad family testing moves to the regression/generalization stage after a causal option
  is discovered.

Protocol:
`docs/strategy/ADAPTIVE_TRANSACTION_SEARCH_V4_PROTOCOL_2026-09-19.md`.

### V47×V48 divergence census: BINDING RESULT

Workflow **`35439729714`** completed SUCCESS on fresh seeds `73001..73004`, both seats.

Decision: **`V48_CENSUS_MARKET_SEARCHABLE`**.

Hard-block result:
- V47 score rate vs V48: **0.0**;
- **0W / 0T / 8L**;
- mean margin **-454.0**;
- **458** same-farmer/hands market divergences;
- **0** farmer/hands divergences;
- zero failures.

The first market divergence appears around step 253/323, with many recurrent later
divergences. The observed V48 pattern repeatedly clears impossible/stale SELL slots or caps
huge V47 quantities (for example `SELL WHEAT 1000`) to feasible current inventory.

Result doc:
`docs/strategy/V47_V48_DIVERGENCE_CENSUS_V1_RESULT_2026-09-19.md`.

### O-CQ1 Queue Clamp/Clear — CLOSED AT PARITY

Workflow **`35439945148`** completed mechanically clean.

Binding decision: **`CQ1_PARITY_FAIL`**.

Against exact V48 action output on fresh audit seeds:
- V48 market-divergence rows: **456**;
- CQ1 changed rows: **1,356**;
- exact V48 matches: **288**;
- false-positive changes: **900**;
- changed-but-not-exact: **168**;
- missed V48 changes: **0**;
- precision: **0.21239**;
- recall: **0.63158**;
- failures: **0**.

The prepared O-CQ1 causal workflow is **NOT RUN** and remains dormant/non-binding.

Mechanistic diagnosis:
- current pre-action shed alone is the wrong availability state;
- Kaggriculture resolves farmer/hand actions before market;
- `DROP`, shed-adjacent `PLACE`, and `PICKUP` can alter shed before SELL;
- market slots execute in order, so an earlier `BUY_PRODUCT` can feed a later SELL;
- V48 also selectively clears/compacts the queue rather than applying a universal clamp.

### O-CQ2 — projected queue sanitation

New development hypothesis:
1. project own shed through the exact current V47 farmer/hands actions using only legal own state;
2. project earlier market inventory-changing slots before later SELLs;
3. test alternative SELL sanitation forms:
   - slotwise clamp;
   - clamp + compaction;
   - same-product shortage merge + compaction;
4. evaluate a small pre-frozen activation-threshold grid;
5. choose one configuration only on development seeds;
6. freeze it and validate on separate untouched seeds before any causal W/L gate.

This is still a **parity/mechanism** stage, not a performance-training stage.

The generic V4A multi-turn market oracle remains prepared but **dormant pending CQ2**.
It should run only if a compact first-party sanitation mechanism cannot explain enough of V48.

### Binding next steps

1. Run O-CQ2 development parity matrix.
2. Freeze exactly one sanitation rule + activation condition from that development result.
3. Validate the frozen rule on separate fresh seeds.
4. If validation parity is strong, open fresh causal V48 W/L gate.
5. If validation parity is weak, activate the already-prepared V4A bounded multi-turn oracle.
6. Keep O-RW1 + O-TW1 as current offline host.
7. No new Kaggle submission; preserve active hosted slots.

### V4E semantic-category decomposition — BINDING RESULT

Workflow **`35450703737`** completed SUCCESS.

Decision: **`V4E_STRUCTURAL_SUFFICIENT_SANITATION_NOT_NECESSARY`**.

FULL exact V48 market inside W2+:
- reproduced contexts: **12/12**;
- score rate: **0.5**;
- mean score delta: **+0.5**;
- mean margin delta: **+585.67**.

ONLY_SANITATION = CLEAR + QTY_DOWN:
- reproduced: **2/12**;
- score rate: 0.1667;
- mean margin delta: +18.67.

ONLY_STRUCTURAL = REPLACE + QTY_UP + OTHER:
- reproduced: **10/12**;
- score rate: **0.5**;
- mean margin delta: **+587.17**.

FULL_MINUS_SANITATION:
- reproduced: **10/12**;
- score rate: **0.5**.

Necessity ablations:
- FULL_MINUS_REPLACE: **0/12**;
- FULL_MINUS_QTY_UP: **2/12**;
- FULL_MINUS_STRUCTURAL: **2/12**.

Necessary categories:
- **REPLACE**;
- **QTY_UP**;
- their structural interaction.

Mechanistic interpretation:
- QTY_UP is primarily merging duplicate SELLs of the same product;
- REPLACE is primarily compaction/movement of later effective SELLs after canonicalization;
- examples include `MILK 6 + MILK 1 -> MILK 7` and `EGG 6 + EGG 4 -> EGG 10`.

Result:
`docs/strategy/V4E_SEMANTIC_CATEGORY_DECOMPOSITION_RESULT_2026-09-19.md`.

### O-LQ2 Late Canonical SELL Queue — ACTIVE

Frozen protocol:
`docs/strategy/O_LQ2_CANONICAL_SELL_QUEUE_CAUSAL_PROTOCOL_2026-09-19.md`.

First-party rule from step 336:
- exact V47 farmer/hands;
- split market into consecutive SELL runs;
- aggregate all duplicate SELL demand per product;
- preserve first-product occurrence order;
- cap aggregate demand to projected available own inventory;
- emit at most one SELL per product;
- drop zero-effective products;
- compact surviving SELLs left inside the run;
- preserve non-SELL orders exactly;
- no V48 runtime input.

Fresh seeds:
`74401..74408`, both seats.

Workflow **`35456018489`**:
`o-lq2-v48-causal-gate`.

PASS requires:
- mean score delta >= +0.125;
- >=4 positive-score contexts;
- 0 negative-score contexts;
- positive mean margin delta.

### Binding next steps

1. Resolve workflow `35456018489`.
2. O-LQ2 PASS -> broad fresh multi-family regression.
3. O-LQ2 WEAK -> confirm only the structural mechanism, not generic threshold search.
4. O-LQ2 FAIL -> inspect structural rule mismatch; do not return to sanitation.
5. No Kaggle submission yet.

## Historical record (superseded where inconsistent with the current handoff)

Updated: 2026-09-15

## North star

Reach prize/top-10 class and maximize probability of 1st place. Frozen external target: ~`2958+` top 10 and ~`3000+` frontier class.

Optimize **competitive W/L/population value**, not novelty, terminal money or local single-panel rating.

## Binding methodological rules

1. Preserve successful historical knowledge unless stronger evidence supersedes it.
2. Economic/mechanics module validity does not imply competitive-backbone validity.
3. Exact-engine tests govern mechanics and causal interventions; local H2H ordering is not a hosted-rating oracle.
4. No post-result threshold ladder for failed architectures without new causal evidence.
5. Use exact hosted/frozen packages whenever possible.
6. No identity/rating/EpisodeId/hidden seed/future/direct opponent-private runtime features.
7. Original final holdout remains sealed.
8. Hosted slots answer high-information transfer questions only.
9. Execution/mechanics failures cannot be interpreted as strategic failures.
10. Router labels must be counterfactual W/L labels or a defensible competitive surrogate, never terminal money alone.

## Completed foundation

Competitive: CR053_REAL remains the strongest exact hosted anchor (~2064.8); CR086 estimator/operator retained; CR087/088 elite macro/replay knowledge retained while direct tape backbones stay closed.

FP001: retain H1, H1B, H8/B3+CARE, H9 representation, H10, H11 and M6S1 as reusable primitives/modules.

Closed integration failures: CR089 static C5/C5+M6S1; CR090 simple H9 species selector.

## R6 — hierarchical competitive controller

Target architecture:

`legal runtime state -> option value -> best separable market/macro option`

Use hosted-proven CR053 as the initial host organism instead of repeatedly replacing the whole agent.

## CR091 — Gate 1 COMPLETE / PASS

Binding run `34990757344`, result `CR091_LATENT_OPTION_TRANSFER_PASS_ADVANCE_ROUTER`.

Exact CR053 plus the exact CR086 latent-supply market-priority operator passed mechanics and population transfer on the four-anchor panel:

- failures 0;
- violations 0;
- exact physical and market-multiset parity;
- 1,075 O1 reorders;
- edge deltas: CR052 `0`, CR053 `+0.1875`, CR083 `0`, CR086 `0`;
- mean edge delta `+0.046875`, worst regression `0`.

Freeze this CR086 priority mechanism as option **O1**. Do not retune it.

Result doc: `docs/strategy/CR091_HIERARCHICAL_MARKET_OPTION_RESULT_2026-09-15.md`.

## CR092 — broad O1 transfer + router-label gate CURRENT

Protocol: `docs/strategy/CR092_BROAD_OPTION_ROUTER_LABEL_PROTOCOL_2026-09-15.md`.

### Question

Does frozen O1 survive the broader 11-edge heterogeneous population, and does its value vary enough across hash-matched public states to justify a learned router?

### Frozen population / execution

Use the exact CR089 frozen population artifact `10378299284`:

- anchors: CR053_REAL, CR052_REAL, CR083, CR086;
- seven macro reps: Majkel/r01, SpaTaro/r02, ymg-Howard/r03, Orbital/r06, feel/r07, Otter/r09, redblack/r10.

Evaluation:

- seeds `91401..91406`;
- both seats;
- BASE and frozen O1;
- 12 games/treatment/edge;
- 264 total episodes;
- 11 edge jobs in parallel;
- hosted-faithful `kaggle-environments==1.32.7` execution.

### Counterfactual dataset

At O1's first actual market reorder, freeze the legal strategic observation and CR086 derived state. The label is admissible only if BASE has the exact same strategic-state hash at the same step for the same opponent/seed/seat.

Primary label: `W/L(O1) - W/L(BASE)`.

Opponent name and seed are offline stratification metadata only; never runtime router features.

### Frozen broad-survival rule

Require all:

- mechanics pass;
- mean edge delta >= `+0.02`;
- >=8/11 nonnegative edges;
- worst regression >= `-0.125`;
- seven-macro mean delta >= `0`;
- no BASE edge >=0.25 becomes O1 score 0.

### Frozen routing signal

Require all:

- branch-state hash-valid labels only;
- >=8 positive labels;
- >=8 negative labels;
- positives from >=2 opponent strata;
- negatives from >=2 opponent strata.

### Frozen outcomes

1. `CR092_BROAD_PASS_HETEROGENEOUS_ADVANCE_ROUTER`  
   Freeze dataset and advance CR093 router(BASE/O1).

2. `CR092_BROAD_PASS_O1_ADVANCE_NEXT_OPTION`  
   O1 is broadly safe but lacks sufficient downside heterogeneity; retain it and add next separable option, initially H1/H1B timing.

3. `CR092_BROAD_FAIL_HETEROGENEOUS_ADVANCE_ROUTER_DISCOVERY`  
   Always-on O1 unsafe, but enough positive/negative causal value exists to justify conditional routing.

4. `CR092_BROAD_FAIL_CLOSE_ALWAYS_ON_O1`  
   Close always-on O1 without tuning; move to H1/H1B option family.

Mechanics failure means no strategic verdict.

### Active implementation

Research branch:

- `tools/cr092_broad_option_edge.py`
- `tools/cr092_aggregate.py`
- `.github/workflows/cr092-broad-option-router-label.yml`
- head commit `b42347617a6967eeb2862fde23737c7538d3b9d3`
- active workflow **`35015135956`**
- prepare job PASS; all 11 frozen packages SHA-verified; edge matrix launched.

## CR093 — public-state router CONDITIONAL

Only if CR092 exposes heterogeneous causal support.

Requirements:

- small auditable feature set frozen before final validation;
- no opponent identity or hidden metadata;
- train only on CR092 admissible hash-matched labels;
- fresh seeds/opponent instances for evaluation;
- controls: always BASE, always O1, router(BASE/O1);
- feature ablations;
- no catastrophe edge.

If CR092 shows O1 is broadly beneficial without meaningful negative support, skip an unnecessary binary router and first add H1/H1B as O2 so routing has a real choice.

## Later separable options

Evaluate one at a time after the current gate:

- H1 town-pulse WHEAT carry;
- H1B owned-sale deferral;
- elite/CR088 market timing/competition handling;
- H11 fertilizer opportunity-cost actions where separable;
- state-compatible production macro options using CR087/088 priors and FP001 modules.

Never reintroduce raw tape splicing without complete state preconditions.

## Hosted calibration

Hosted-worthy only after exact mechanics, fresh broad W/L survival, no major catastrophe edge and a strategically distinct transfer question. CR092 itself does not automatically authorize submission.

## Permanent stop list absent new evidence

CR080 replay stitching; CR081 static market-prefix transplant; CR082 1-NN imitation; CR084 FEED rescue; CR085 Pareto gating; direct CR088 tape backbones; static C5/C5+M6S1; fixed C3S2/C2S3; CR090 simple first-shop species rule.

## Immediate action

Let CR092 workflow `35015135956` complete. On the next status check, read its aggregate result once and obey the frozen branch. No manual Kaggle submission.
