# ROADMAP — Kculture live plan

## Current solver handoff — 2026-09-18

Active branch: `research/prize-solver-v0`.

The standalone programme router is closed. Synthetic one-turn SELL reorder/deferral also
closed. The important solver line is now the first-party ready-stock option discovered
through exact wrapper-proposal search.

### V2b wrapper-proposal oracle — PASS

Workflow `35310754131`, exact engine `1.32.7`:
- 16 valid branch states / zero failures;
- BASE score rate `0.500`;
- oracle score rate `0.625`;
- W/L delta **+0.125**;
- four non-win -> win flips;
- every promoted proposal came from Ready Stock;
- useful proposal: V47 market empty -> `SELL WOOL 2`, farmer/hands unchanged.

Result:
`docs/strategy/ADAPTIVE_WRAPPER_PROPOSAL_V2B_RESULT_2026-09-18.md`.

### O-RW1 first-party causal isolation — PASS SAFE OPTION

Workflow `35311750191`, artifact `10533792019`, exact engine `1.32.7`:
- 48 valid counterfactual branch states;
- mean W/L score delta **+0.1666667**;
- 16 non-win -> win flips;
- **0 negative-W/L states**;
- **0 win -> non-win regressions**;
- mean terminal-margin delta **+14.9583**;
- **0 negative-margin states**.

By opponent:
- V47 mirror: score delta `+0.25`;
- V48: score delta `+0.25`;
- Tactical Memory: score delta `0.0`, mean margin delta `+35.125`.

Frozen first-party option **O-RW1**:

```
if V47 market == []
and own private shed.WOOL >= 2
and step <= 671:
    proposal = SELL WOOL 2
```

This uses current legal own state only. No Ready Stock code, opponent identity, future,
seed or hidden opponent state is needed.

Binding result:
`docs/strategy/FIRST_PARTY_READY_WOOL_CAUSAL_RESULT_2026-09-18.md`.
Machine-readable:
`data/programme_teacher/2026-09-18/READY_WOOL_CAUSAL_GATE_SUMMARY.json`.

### Current binding gate — O-RW1 one-shot runtime transfer

Protocol:
`docs/strategy/READY_WOOL_ONESHOT_RUNTIME_GATE_2026-09-18.md`.

Treatment is exact V47 plus O-RW1 firing **at most once**, at the first eligible state.
No parameter/product/quantity/step tuning.

Fresh seeds `65001..65008`, both seats, four opponents:
V47, V48, Tactical Memory and Ready Stock.

64 paired matchups / 128 complete episodes planned. Pre-trigger observation and exact V47
base-action parity are checked. No-trigger episodes must be exactly identical.

Active workflow: **`35313204723`**.

A PASS freezes O-RW1 as a runtime-safe first-party solver option and authorizes building a
reproducible candidate package plus hosted-probe proposal. It does not automatically
submit to Kaggle.

No Ryzen action and no manual Kaggle submission are currently required.

The FP001_STATUS/FP001_ROADMAP files are absent on this branch; do not silently create
competing copies or change other branches as part of this solver update.

## Historical record (superseded where inconsistent with the current handoff)

Updated: 2026-09-15

## North star

Reach prize/top-10 class and maximize probability of 1st place. Frozen external target: ~`2958+` top 10 and ~`3000+` frontier class.

Optimize **competitive W/L/population value**, not novelty, terminal money or local single-panel rating.

## Binding methodological rules

1. Preserve successful historical knowledge unless stronger evidence supersedes it.
2. Economic/mechanics module validity does not imply competitive-backbone validity.
3. Exact-engine tests govern mechanics and causal interventions; local H2H ordering is not a hosted-rating oracle.
4. No post-result threshold ladder for failed architectures without new causal evidence.
5. Use exact hosted/frozen packages whenever possible.
6. No identity/rating/EpisodeId/hidden seed/future/direct opponent-private runtime features.
7. Original final holdout remains sealed.
8. Hosted slots answer high-information transfer questions only.
9. Execution/mechanics failures cannot be interpreted as strategic failures.
10. Router labels must be counterfactual W/L labels or a defensible competitive surrogate, never terminal money alone.

## Completed foundation

Competitive: CR053_REAL remains the strongest exact hosted anchor (~2064.8); CR086 estimator/operator retained; CR087/088 elite macro/replay knowledge retained while direct tape backbones stay closed.

FP001: retain H1, H1B, H8/B3+CARE, H9 representation, H10, H11 and M6S1 as reusable primitives/modules.

Closed integration failures: CR089 static C5/C5+M6S1; CR090 simple H9 species selector.

## R6 — hierarchical competitive controller

Target architecture:

`legal runtime state -> option value -> best separable market/macro option`

Use hosted-proven CR053 as the initial host organism instead of repeatedly replacing the whole agent.

## CR091 — Gate 1 COMPLETE / PASS

Binding run `34990757344`, result `CR091_LATENT_OPTION_TRANSFER_PASS_ADVANCE_ROUTER`.

Exact CR053 plus the exact CR086 latent-supply market-priority operator passed mechanics and population transfer on the four-anchor panel:

- failures 0;
- violations 0;
- exact physical and market-multiset parity;
- 1,075 O1 reorders;
- edge deltas: CR052 `0`, CR053 `+0.1875`, CR083 `0`, CR086 `0`;
- mean edge delta `+0.046875`, worst regression `0`.

Freeze this CR086 priority mechanism as option **O1**. Do not retune it.

Result doc: `docs/strategy/CR091_HIERARCHICAL_MARKET_OPTION_RESULT_2026-09-15.md`.

## CR092 — broad O1 transfer + router-label gate CURRENT

Protocol: `docs/strategy/CR092_BROAD_OPTION_ROUTER_LABEL_PROTOCOL_2026-09-15.md`.

### Question

Does frozen O1 survive the broader 11-edge heterogeneous population, and does its value vary enough across hash-matched public states to justify a learned router?

### Frozen population / execution

Use the exact CR089 frozen population artifact `10378299284`:

- anchors: CR053_REAL, CR052_REAL, CR083, CR086;
- seven macro reps: Majkel/r01, SpaTaro/r02, ymg-Howard/r03, Orbital/r06, feel/r07, Otter/r09, redblack/r10.

Evaluation:

- seeds `91401..91406`;
- both seats;
- BASE and frozen O1;
- 12 games/treatment/edge;
- 264 total episodes;
- 11 edge jobs in parallel;
- hosted-faithful `kaggle-environments==1.32.7` execution.

### Counterfactual dataset

At O1's first actual market reorder, freeze the legal strategic observation and CR086 derived state. The label is admissible only if BASE has the exact same strategic-state hash at the same step for the same opponent/seed/seat.

Primary label: `W/L(O1) - W/L(BASE)`.

Opponent name and seed are offline stratification metadata only; never runtime router features.

### Frozen broad-survival rule

Require all:

- mechanics pass;
- mean edge delta >= `+0.02`;
- >=8/11 nonnegative edges;
- worst regression >= `-0.125`;
- seven-macro mean delta >= `0`;
- no BASE edge >=0.25 becomes O1 score 0.

### Frozen routing signal

Require all:

- branch-state hash-valid labels only;
- >=8 positive labels;
- >=8 negative labels;
- positives from >=2 opponent strata;
- negatives from >=2 opponent strata.

### Frozen outcomes

1. `CR092_BROAD_PASS_HETEROGENEOUS_ADVANCE_ROUTER`  
   Freeze dataset and advance CR093 router(BASE/O1).

2. `CR092_BROAD_PASS_O1_ADVANCE_NEXT_OPTION`  
   O1 is broadly safe but lacks sufficient downside heterogeneity; retain it and add next separable option, initially H1/H1B timing.

3. `CR092_BROAD_FAIL_HETEROGENEOUS_ADVANCE_ROUTER_DISCOVERY`  
   Always-on O1 unsafe, but enough positive/negative causal value exists to justify conditional routing.

4. `CR092_BROAD_FAIL_CLOSE_ALWAYS_ON_O1`  
   Close always-on O1 without tuning; move to H1/H1B option family.

Mechanics failure means no strategic verdict.

### Active implementation

Research branch:

- `tools/cr092_broad_option_edge.py`
- `tools/cr092_aggregate.py`
- `.github/workflows/cr092-broad-option-router-label.yml`
- head commit `b42347617a6967eeb2862fde23737c7538d3b9d3`
- active workflow **`35015135956`**
- prepare job PASS; all 11 frozen packages SHA-verified; edge matrix launched.

## CR093 — public-state router CONDITIONAL

Only if CR092 exposes heterogeneous causal support.

Requirements:

- small auditable feature set frozen before final validation;
- no opponent identity or hidden metadata;
- train only on CR092 admissible hash-matched labels;
- fresh seeds/opponent instances for evaluation;
- controls: always BASE, always O1, router(BASE/O1);
- feature ablations;
- no catastrophe edge.

If CR092 shows O1 is broadly beneficial without meaningful negative support, skip an unnecessary binary router and first add H1/H1B as O2 so routing has a real choice.

## Later separable options

Evaluate one at a time after the current gate:

- H1 town-pulse WHEAT carry;
- H1B owned-sale deferral;
- elite/CR088 market timing/competition handling;
- H11 fertilizer opportunity-cost actions where separable;
- state-compatible production macro options using CR087/088 priors and FP001 modules.

Never reintroduce raw tape splicing without complete state preconditions.

## Hosted calibration

Hosted-worthy only after exact mechanics, fresh broad W/L survival, no major catastrophe edge and a strategically distinct transfer question. CR092 itself does not automatically authorize submission.

## Permanent stop list absent new evidence

CR080 replay stitching; CR081 static market-prefix transplant; CR082 1-NN imitation; CR084 FEED rescue; CR085 Pareto gating; direct CR088 tape backbones; static C5/C5+M6S1; fixed C3S2/C2S3; CR090 simple first-shop species rule.

## Immediate action

Let CR092 workflow `35015135956` complete. On the next status check, read its aggregate result once and obey the frozen branch. No manual Kaggle submission.
